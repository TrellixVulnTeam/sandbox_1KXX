# File No Overwrite Sandbox

This is to address a question on [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48588037/i-want-to-create-a-text-file-in-cpp-using-ofstream)
asking if there is a way to check for the existence of a file, if it exists,
then use a new filename, etc.

# My Answer

I am assuming that if you can write to the file, then you can also read from
it, although that's not necessarily always the case.
