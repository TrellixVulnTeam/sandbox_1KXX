# TODO's

- [ ] (maybe) implement word wrap for descriptions
- [ ] descriptions: prefix each line with spaces to line up
- [ ] add name and description for remaining arguments.  This is different from
      positional arguments.  It would be the way to add a positional argument
      that take the rest of the arguments.
      (call it `set_remaining_description()`)
- [ ] allow a default value in the parser with `set_default()`.  Have this
      printed in the help message.
