# 3D Printer Notes with Ian

I want to buy a 3D printer

budget: $300 - $500

## Resin with casting

- amazing detail
- resin print, put in cast, burn it out
- youtuber: VegOilGuy (VOG)
  - mainly jewelry


## Backbone

- Printing it vertically would be a mistake, it would snap on a ring layer
- Maybe would work with TPU or with "rubber-like" PLA
- TPU is promising

## Materials

TPU

- ripping is quite hard
- can bend
- supports cannot be ripped away
- roll is about $24
- spectrum
  - from rubber-band-like to a lot flexible
  - shore hardness rating
  - the softer you go, the harder it is to print
  - Ian has used a shore hardness of about 87-A (like the heel of a shoe)

PLA: $20 / roll (~1kg)

- Good for rigid bodies
- PLA
  - shatters
- PLA pro
- PLA plus
  - more resilient to shattering
- PLA soft

PETg

- Prints pretty easily
- Stronger than PLA
- Less rigid, a little bit more flexible


## Extruder

### Bowden Extruder

If you only print with harder things, you can use a Bowden extruder

- Bowden are cheaper
- Good for hard materials
- Robert printed TPU with a Boden just fine


### Direct Drive

- more expensive
- better handles softer materials
- handles hard materials just fine


## Printer

### Good Value

Creality Ender 3

- If you can use a Bowden, this is a good option
- Robert has this printer
  - He has modified it extremely
- ~ $240

They make other printers and they do a good job.


### Higher end

Prusa (Prusha)

- 25cm wide x 21cm deep x 21cm tall
- ~ $750

There is a Prusa mini with a smaller build area


## Software

Slic3r
- Open source
- Good software

PrusaSlicer
- Open source
- Fork of Slic3r
- Ian prefers this one
- Similar to Slic3r
- Can be used with any printer
- May have some different features
