\begin{recipe}
  \step{
    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray three 8-inch or four 6-inch round
    cake pans with non-stick spray, add parchment and another coat of spray.
    Set aside.
    }
  \step{
    In a medium size bowl, sift the cake flour and baking powder. Set aside.
    }
  \step{
    In the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the
    butter, canola oil, salt and sugar on high until fluffy and smooth, about 5
    minutes.
    }
  \step{
    Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time to the bowl and beat on medium
    until well incorporated.
    }
  \step{
    Turn the mixer on low and add 1/3 of the flour mixture to the butter
    mixture and mix until fully incorporated. Then add half of the sour cream
    and blend well, followed by another 1/3 of the flour mixture, the second
    half of the sour cream and lastly, add the remaining flour mixture and mix
    until incorporated.
    }
  \step{
    Add the clear vanilla extract and butter extract and beat on low until
    incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix on low for another
    30 seconds.
    }
  \step{
    Evenly distribute the cake batter among the three pans and bake for 25-30
    minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cakes comes
    out clean or with just a few crumbs. Make sure not to over bake.
    }
  \step{
    Remove cakes from the oven and let cool in pans for 10 minutes before
    inverting onto cooling racks.
    }
  \step{
    Once completely cooled, wrap in plastic wrap and place in the freezer or
    refrigerator to chill before frosting.
    }
  \substep[Lemon Curd]{
    Whisk the sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a medium saucepan. Whisk in
    the whole eggs and yolks in a small bowl and then whisk them into the lemon
    mixture.
    }
  \substep[Lemon Curd]{
    Cook the mixture over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until it's
    thick like pudding, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in
    the butter, a few pieces at a time until incorporated.
    }
  \substep[Lemon Curd]{
    Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pushing it
    through with a rubber spatula. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface
    to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until completely set, at least
    4 hours and up to 5 days.
